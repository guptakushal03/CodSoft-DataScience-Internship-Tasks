### Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

**Objective**: 
Build a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on passenger features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

**Model Used**: 
Logistic Regression

**Dataset**: [Titanic Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

**Steps**:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed the dataset, handling missing values and categorical data.
2. Model Building: Trained a Logistic Regression model.
3. Evaluation: Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction

**Objective**: 
Build a regression model to predict movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, and actors.

**Model Used**: 
Linear Regression and Ridge Regression

**Dataset**: [IMDB India Movies Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies)

**Steps**:
1. Data Preprocessing: Processed categorical data, handled missing values, and performed feature engineering.
2. Model Building: Trained Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models to predict movie ratings.
3. Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

### Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

**Objective**: 
Classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

**Model Used**: 
Logistic Regression

**Dataset**: [Iris Flower Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)

**Steps**:
1. Data Preprocessing: Loaded and explored the dataset, handled missing values (if any), and scaled the data.
2. Model Building: Trained a Logistic Regression model for multi-class classification.
3. Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### Task 4: Sales Prediction

**Objective**: 
Predict sales of a product based on factors such as advertising expenditure and marketing strategies.

**Model Used**: 
Random Forest Regression

**Dataset**: [Sales Prediction Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input)

**Steps**:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Model Building: Trained a Random Forest Regressor model to predict sales.
3. Evaluation: Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
